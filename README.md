TheOtherHalf
============

Jolla - The Other Half 3D model (just a proto, not official)

NOTE: The models are optimized for my printer. Therefore they may not fit perfectly if printed with other printers. This includes Shapeways and other 3D printing services.

NOTE2: I have now tested the model with ABS and another printer too. Scale the models about 1 % up before printing if ABS is used because it seems to shrink more than PLA.

Printed with [Tinkerine Studio Litto](http://www.tinkerines.com/store/3d-printers/litto/) 3D printer.

Tested with these settings (PLA, close to perfect fit):

- layer resolution 0.2 mm
- first layer temp: 210 Celsius
- other layers: 185 Celsius
- fan ON at layer 4
- no skirt lines
- organic clip

Powdered sugar + water was used on top of masking tape to ensure that the first layer sticks.
